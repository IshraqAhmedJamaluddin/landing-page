## Project

This is a frontend project (landing page) that has a self-popilating navbar, each time you add a section a navbar is created for that section. With a link to lead you there.

And each time you scroll to a section it is highlighted.

When you're near the bottom there's a back to top button to press

When you don't scroll the navbar is hidden

Updates:
The scroll is done by the scrollToView function. The sections are added dynamically as well using a for loop.

## Dependencies

You don't need to install any dependencies

- index.html

css
- styles.css

js
- app.js

The html has the skeleton of the landing page

The css has the styles

The javascript has most of the functionality of adding sections/ navbar items/ back to top button, and so on.

To run the code you just need to double click the index.html to open in a web browser.

If you are a developer you can open it using live server extension in vscode
