## Project

This is a frontend project (landing page) that has a self-popilating navbar, each time you add a section a navbar is created for that section. With a link to lead you there.

And each time you scroll to a section it is highlighted.

When you're near the bottom there's a back to top button to press

When you don't scroll the navbar is hidden
